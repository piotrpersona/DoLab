I want you to setup React application.
The application will be used to label dataset of images with JSON objects.

## Architecture
This will be React Typescript application, that will start locally with the path to local directory.
The local directory will be passed via envrionment variable and will be absolute path to directory with images.
The application will start on localhost and display UI

The application will display 2 panes.
1st pane (70% width) - the image
2nd pane (30% width) JSON text editor

Above the image there will be displayed image basename.
In the JSON editor it will be possible to submit only JSON-like objects.
The edit should have option to prettify the JSON on demand.

Below text editor there will be readonly text area that will display a single JSON record.
A single json record will have 2 keys:
- file_name, which is path to image
- ground_truth which contains serialized one-line json.

the ground truth should be in format:
```json
{
    "gt_parse": {} // object that was types in the JSON text editor
}
```
example metadata record
```json
{"file_name":"images/123.jpg","ground_truth":"{\\"gt_parse\\": {\\"amount\\": 1234.32}}"}
```
The user submits the record by "Save" button, which will save the record in local `metadata/` directory with filename `{image_filename}_metadata.sjonl`.

User will navigate using buttons previous/next to select next photo and label it with JSON.

Finally user will have option to press "Export" that will merge all lines of *_metadata.jsonl files into a single `metadata.jsonl` file and download it
